# Description
Autolib is an electric car sharing company that rents out three types of cars i.e the bluecar, utilib and the utilib 14. The company operates in different locations in the city of Paris operating over the week. I have conducted an analysis and found that the blue car is the most popular and thus localised my efforts to this paramter. The company would like to strategically allocate its resources to maximise returns, through exploiting trends displayed during the weekdays and weekends and across different locations. By dividing the datasets into different freames relative to day of week (mondays and fridays), type of day(weekends or weekdays) and different postal codes, we are able to test whether or not there is a difference in the number of blue cars take. This could help mamagemnt in allocating resources based on days and locations that generate the most revenue.
